# github-workflow-event-json

This repository contains JSON files for the many different event payloads and context variables available to a GitHub workflow.
Any activity on this repository is recorded by [.github/workflows/sink.yml](.github/workflows/sink.yml), which commits back all context variables into this repository, as JSON.

## `github`

This GitHub Actions context variable contains the event payload, it will be different based on what kind of event triggered a workflow.
You can find it for a specific event in `${event}__${action}.json` or when the event has no action types, just `${event}.json`.

- Event `pull_request_target` with type `closed` can be found as [pull_request_target__closed.json](./pull_request_target__closed.json)
- Event `push` can be found as [push.json](./push.json)
